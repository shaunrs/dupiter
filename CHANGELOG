v0.0.4
	* Fix variable function error in CryptoService
	* Fix variable spelling area in File

v0.0.3
	* Main: Additional logging in debug mode
	* Skip files in recursive function now actually skips the foreach iteration
	* Main: try/catch blocks added around many object calls
	* Main: Timing of various function added, and output
	* Main: Statistics output delayed until all functions complete as an overview
	* Main: Moved file listing operations to allow listing without moving and vice versa
	* Main: Addition of various command-line parameters:
	* 	--debug flag now operates debug mode on/off
	* 	--list flag now operates the duplicate file listing
	* 	--move flag will move duplicates into a specified directory
	* 	--cleandirs flag will recursively remove empty directories from the source tree

	?? Exception Handler
	?? File moving / deletion - make deletion require confirmation i.e.
		--delete --confirm  : without both, no deletes
	?? Ideally, Directory should be an object - we could list, ask if empty and delete in a single function

v0.0.2
	* Main: Allow the use of exclusion strings
	* Main: Addition of a debug mode for additional output
	* Main: Output some values, such as directories and process statistics
	* ChecksumDB: Store *all* files and their associated checksums, including duplicates
	* ChecksumDB: Link duplicate files with their parent, so that we can display them later on
	* ChecksumDB: Fix count for all files processed

v0.0.1
	* Initial codebase - find duplicates and display their file names as a list
